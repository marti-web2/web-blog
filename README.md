<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>React</strong> - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create the frontend of web applications, and is especially useful for creating large and complex applications that require efficient data management. React allows developers to create reusable UI components, and makes it easier to reason about the state of the application. For more information, see the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">official documentation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Express</strong> - Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used to build the backend of web applications, and provides a number of features for building APIs, routing, and middleware. Express is lightweight and flexible, and is a popular choice for building web applications with Node.js. For more information, see the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html">official documentation</a>.

    <strong>MongoDB</strong> - MongoDB is a database system that is designed to store large amounts of data in a flexible and scalable manner. It is a NoSQL database, which means that it stores data in a format that is different from traditional relational databases. MongoDB is particularly well-suited for storing data in JSON-like documents, and is often used in modern web applications.
